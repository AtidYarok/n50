            and control centers, which can dispatch, monitor, record and store
            data and control from a single central location. Officers are
            training in a variety of monitoring and recording equipment, as well
            as communications equipment, devices and procedures. Officers are
            trained and schooled in crises situations, including such as
            emergencies as fire and or earthquake evacuations. Procedures and
            protocols, range from local security command and control to
            notifications and assistance to police, fire, medical and first
            responders.

            Whether it is a dispatch center, camera monitoring assignment or the
            solitary security officer on a post, they all have one thing in
            common, 24-7-365 communication. Every employee has the availability
            of communication at anytime that they are on duty, via radio or
            cellular phone. Their supervisors, and in some cases, their clients,
            are available at all times if so needed or notifications need to be
            made. In turn supervisors are able to contact management if needed
            anytime. Clients may contact the security officer, the supervisor or
            management at anytime.

            Needless to say, communications are critical in the security
            business. Communications in written form, i.e; DAR’s and Reports are
            submitted daily.
